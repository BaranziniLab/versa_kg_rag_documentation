## Using KG-RAG in UCSF Versa

KG-RAG is available in UCSF Versa as a specialized assistant that enables biomedical question-answering using SPOKE knowledge. Here's how to effectively use KG-RAG in Versa:


### Getting Started

1. **Connect to UCSF VPN**
To access the Versa application, users must first connect to the UCSF VPN.

2. **Select the Assistant**
   - Choose "SPOKE - Knowledge Graph" from the Assistants dropdown menu of Versa
   - Select your preferred language model (e.g., GPT-4o)

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/versa-ui.png" alt="Versa Interface" width="800"/>
  <p><i>Versa interface showing SPOKE Knowledge Graph selection (which uses KG-RAG in the backend)</i></p>
</div>

3. **Frame Your Question**
   - Currently, Versa accepts only disease-related queries (i.e. queries that have disease names mentioned in it. e.g. <i>what are the genes associated with multiple sclerosis?</i>)
   - Be specific and clear in your questions

> üí° **Disease Coverage**: SPOKE contains 11,697 disease concepts, providing comprehensive coverage across various medical domains. This means users can inquire about a wide spectrum of diseases, from common conditions to rare disorders, all backed by verified biomedical knowledge.


### Current Implementation Notes
- For now, Versa's KG-RAG implementation focuses on disease-centric questions
- Responses will include information sourced from SPOKE
- While statistical evidence is available in SPOKE, the current Versa implementation doesn't use that (you can get that information using [KG-RAG API](#api-access))

### Response Structure in Versa
KG-RAG in Versa provides structured responses in three sections:

1. **SPOKE-Prioritized Response**
   - Presents findings directly from SPOKE knowledge base
   - Lists entities with their relationships
   - Includes provenance information (data sources)
   - Complemented with relevant LLM knowledge

2. **Analysis Without SPOKE**
   - Provides context from LLM's training
   - Offers additional insights
   - Helps validate and complement SPOKE information

3. **Summary**
   - Combines insights from both sources
   - Highlights key findings from SPOKE
   - Includes additional context from LLM
   - Provides comprehensive conclusions

> üí° **Example Response Format:**
```text
SECTION 1 - SPOKE-PRIORITIZED RESPONSE:
Based on SPOKE knowledge base:
* Information directly from SPOKE with provenance
* Additional context from LLM

SECTION 2 - ANALYSIS WITHOUT SPOKE:
Based on trained biomedical knowledge:
* LLM's knowledge about the topic without using SPOKE

SECTION 3 - SUMMARY:
From Section 1 (with SPOKE):
* Key findings from SPOKE

From Section 2 (without SPOKE):
* Key findings from LLM

Final comprehensive conclusion combining insights from Section 1 and Section 2.
```

### Best Practices - Recommended Query Types

#### ‚úÖ Direct Queries
Based on SPOKE's knowledge graph structure, you can ask questions about:

üîé **Gene-Disease Associations**
*Example: "What genes are associated with Acute Monocytic Leukemia?"*

üîé **Disease-Disease Similarity**
*Example: "Which diseases are similar to Parkinson's disease?"*

üîé **Disease-Disease Ontology**
*Example: "What is the disease ontology of Alzheimer's disease?"*

üîé **Disease-Drug Treatments**
*Example: "What drugs are used to treat multiple sclerosis?"*

üîé **Disease-Symptom Relationships**
*Example: "What are the symptoms of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome?"*

üîé **Disease-Organism Associations**
*Example: "Which organisms can cause pneumonia?"*

üîé **Disease-Anatomy Localization**
*Example: "Which anatomical structures are affected by diabetes?"*

#### ‚úÖ Intersection Queries
KG-RAG also supports queries that combine multiple relationship types or explore intersections between two or more diseases. Here are some examples:

üîé **Disease-Gene-Disease Connections**
*Example: "What genes are common between Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease?"*

üîé **Disease-Symptom-Disease Patterns**
*Example: "What symptoms are shared between multiple sclerosis and lupus?"*

üîé **Disease-Drug-Disease Relationships**
*Example: "What drugs are used to treat both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis?"*

üîé **Disease-Anatomy-Disease Associations**
*Example: "Which anatomical structures are affected by both diabetes and hypertension?"*

> üí° **Tip**: When forming intersection queries, clearly specify both diseases and the relationship type you're interested in exploring between them.

### Limitations

#### üïí Response Time
Current average response time:
 - GPT-4o: 24.5 ¬± 17.7 seconds
 - GPT-4: 30.3 ¬± 9.6 seconds

These latencies are due to multiple API calls in the backend pipeline:
1. User query ‚Üí GPT API (disease entity extraction)
2. Azure API (semantic search)
3. KG-RAG API (context extraction from SPOKE)
4. GPT API (response generation and summarization)

#### üéØ Query Scope
- Currently limited to disease-centric questions
- Queries must explicitly mention disease names
- Other biomedical queries (e.g., drug-protein interactions without disease context) are not supported in the current Versa implementation
- For broader biomedical queries, consider using the [KG-RAG API](#api-access)

#### üîç Graph Search Depth
- Versa's implementation uses single-hop graph search for optimal performance
- While deeper graph searches are possible through the KG-RAG API, they result in:
 - Exponential increase in response time
 - Larger context volume
 - Higher API costs
