## What is SPOKE?

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/spoke-logo.png" alt="SPOKE Logo" width="200"/>
  <p><i>SPOKE: Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine</i></p>
</div>

SPOKE (Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine) is UCSF's comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph that integrates and connects information from over 40 specialized databases. It serves as a unified platform for biomedical knowledge, making complex relationships between different biological entities discoverable and accessible.

### Key Statistics
- **Nodes**: 27+ million nodes of 21 different types
- **Edges**: 53+ million edges of 55 different types
- **Sources**: Integrates 41+ specialized biomedical databases
- **Updates**: Refreshed weekly to ensure current information

### Data Quality
- Prioritizes experimentally validated information
- Maintains clear provenance for all relationships
- Provides statistical evidence when available (p-values, z-score, confidence scores)
- Focuses on curated databases rather than text mining

### Example SPOKE Relationships
- Disease-Disease Ontology associations
- Disease-Gene associations
- Disease-Symptom relationships
- Disease-Compound associations
- Compound-Protein interactions
- Protein-Protein interactions
- Anatomical hierarchies
and many more

## What is KG-RAG?

KG-RAG (Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a specialized framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with SPOKE's biomedical knowledge. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with verified biomedical information from SPOKE, KG-RAG provides reliable, evidence-based responses to biomedical questions.

### Core Components

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
   - Advanced AI models like GPT-4
   - Natural language understanding and generation
   - Reasoning capabilities

2. **SPOKE Knowledge Graph**
   - Verified biomedical knowledge
   - Structured relationships
   - Statistical evidence and provenance

3. **Sentence Transformers**
   - Creates embeddings of biomedical context from SPOKE
   - Creates embeddings of user queries
   - Enables context pruning through semantic similarity, thereby optimizes the knowledge retrieval

### How It Works

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/kg-rag-workflow.png" alt="KG-RAG Workflow" width="800"/>
  <p><i>KG-RAG's workflow for processing biomedical queries</i></p>
</div>

1. **Disease Recognition**
   - Uses sentence transformers to embed user questions
   - Matches with disease entities in SPOKE
   - Ensures accurate disease identification

2. **Context Retrieval & Pruning**
   - Extracts relevant context from SPOKE
   - Uses sentence transformers to embed biomedical context
   - Prunes context based on semantic similarity to query

3. **Context Enhancement**
   - Combines pruned knowledge with LLM capabilities
   - Pruning optimizes the token utilization for the LLM
   - Preserves evidence and provenance information

4. **Response Generation**
   - Generates comprehensive answers grounded on factual biomedical knowledge from SPOKE
   - Includes evidence-based support
   - Maintains scientific accuracy
   - Provided provenance in the generated text 

### Core Features & Benefits

#### üéØ Knowledge-Grounded Responses
- **Verified Information**
  - Responses backed by SPOKE's curated biomedical knowledge
  - Clear provenance for all information

- **Scientific Accuracy**
  - Statistical evidence when available (Note: Versa maynot support this, but KG-RAG API does)
  - Multiple source validation

#### üîç Advanced Query Processing
- **Intelligent Disease Recognition**
  - Robust entity recognition using embeddings
  - Handles variations in disease names
  - Maps to standardized disease concepts

- **Smart Context Retrieval**
  - Semantic matching for relevant information
  - Efficient pruning of knowledge graph data
  - Optimal context selection

#### ‚ö° Enhanced Performance
- **Token Efficiency**
  - Optimized context selection
  - Reduced token usage compared to traditional RAG
  - Cost-effective implementation

- **Consistent Results**
  - Stable responses across LLM updates
  - Evidence-based conclusions

### Example KG-RAG Capabilities

  <p><i>Examples of KG-RAG's comprehensive responses with statistical evidence. Note that these queries were run in March 2024 using GPT-4. When running the same queries today, GPT-4-only responses (blue box) may differ from those shown in the figure due to the possible model updates from OpenAI.</i></p>
</div>

#### Example 1: Drug-Disease Relationships
**Query**: "Are there any latest drugs used for weight management in patients with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome?"

KG-RAG provides:
- Retrieves drug treatment information from SPOKE
- Shows clinical trial phase (Phase 3)
- Includes multiple source databases (ChEMBL, DrugCentral)
- Provides clear provenance for information

#### Example 2: Gene-Disease Associations
**Query**: "Is it PNPLA3 or HLA-B that has a significant association with the disease liver benign neoplasm?"

KG-RAG provides:
- Comparative statistical analysis
- Precise p-values (PNPLA3: 4e-14, HLA-B: 2e-08)
- Source attribution (GWAS Catalog)
- Evidence-based conclusion

> üí° Note: These examples demonstrate KG-RAG's full capabilities with statistical evidence. The current Versa implementation may have different features, which we'll discuss in the [Using KG-RAG in Versa](#using-kg-rag-in-versa) section.

## Using KG-RAG in Versa

KG-RAG is available in Versa as a specialized assistant that enables biomedical question-answering using SPOKE knowledge. Here's how to effectively use KG-RAG in Versa:


### Getting Started
1. **Select the Assistant**
   - Choose "SPOKE - Knowledge Graph" from the Assistants dropdown
   - Select your preferred language model (e.g., GPT-4o)

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/versa-ui.png" alt="Versa Interface" width="800"/>
  <p><i>Versa interface showing SPOKE Knowledge Graph selection (which uses KG-RAG in the backend)</i></p>
</div>

2. **Frame Your Question**
   - Currently, Versa accepts only disease-related queries (i.e. queries that have disease names mentioned in it. e.g. <i>what are the genes associated with multiple sclerosis?</i>)
   - Be specific and clear in your questions

### Current Implementation Notes
- For now, Versa's KG-RAG implementation focuses on disease-centric questions
- Responses will include information sourced from SPOKE
- While statistical evidence is available in SPOKE, the current Versa implementation doesn't use that (you can get that information using [KG-RAG API](#api-access))

### Current Implementation Notes
- For now, Versa's KG-RAG implementation focuses on disease-centric questions
- Responses will include information sourced from SPOKE
- While statistical evidence is available in SPOKE, the current Versa implementation doesn't use that (you can get that information using [KG-RAG API](#api-access))

### Response Structure in Versa
KG-RAG in Versa provides structured responses in three sections:

1. **SPOKE-Prioritized Response**
   - Presents findings directly from SPOKE knowledge base
   - Lists entities with their relationships
   - Includes provenance information (data sources)
   - Complemented with relevant LLM knowledge

2. **Analysis Without SPOKE**
   - Provides context from LLM's training
   - Offers additional insights
   - Helps validate and complement SPOKE information

3. **Summary**
   - Combines insights from both sources
   - Highlights key findings from SPOKE
   - Includes additional context from LLM
   - Provides comprehensive conclusions

> üí° **Example Response Format:**
```text
SECTION 1 - SPOKE-PRIORITIZED RESPONSE:
Based on SPOKE knowledge base:
* Information directly from SPOKE with provenance
* Additional context from LLM

SECTION 2 - ANALYSIS WITHOUT SPOKE:
Based on trained biomedical knowledge:
* LLM's knowledge about the topic without using SPOKE

SECTION 3 - SUMMARY:
From Section 1 (with SPOKE):
* Key findings from SPOKE

From Section 2 (without SPOKE):
* Key findings from LLM

Final comprehensive conclusion combining insights from Section 1 and Section 2.
```

### Best Practices
