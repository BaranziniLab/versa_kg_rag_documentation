Fatigue: Both conditions commonly cause significant fatigue.
Cognitive Dysfunction: Memory issues and cognitive impairment are seen in both diseases.
Muscle and Joint Pain: While MS causes muscle spasticity, lupus can cause muscle pain and joint pain.
Vision Problems: Both diseases can lead to vision disturbances.
Gait and Mobility Issues: Both conditions can affect mobility, though through different mechanisms.
Sleep Disturbances: Both conditions can lead to sleep problems due to pain, fatigue, or other symptoms.

Shared symptoms between MS and lupus include fatigue, memory disorders, muscle spasticity (or muscle pain in lupus), vision disorders, gait disorders, and sleep-wake disorders. Provenance for these associations is primarily from NCBI PubMed.
From Section 2 (without SPOKE):

Additional shared symptoms include cognitive dysfunction, muscle and joint pain, and mobility issues. These insights are based on general biomedical knowledge.
Summary:
Both multiple sclerosis and lupus share several symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, muscle and joint pain, vision problems, gait and mobility issues, and sleep disturbances. The SPOKE knowledge base provides a solid foundation for these associations, supplemented by broader biomedical knowledge to fill in any gaps. For any specific treatment or medication advice, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional.

To provide a complete answer, I’ll add information from my trained biomedical knowledge along with this:

Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS):
A first episode of neurological symptoms lasting at least 24 hours, caused by inflammation or demyelination in the central nervous system. It may or may not develop into multiple sclerosis.
SECTION 2 - ANALYSIS WITHOUT SPOKE (USING KNOWLEDGE FROM LLM TRAINING):
Based on my trained biomedical knowledge, the different types of multiple sclerosis (MS) include:

Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS):

A single episode of neurological symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the central nervous system. It may or may not progress to MS.
Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS):

Characterized by episodes of new or increasing neurological symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions).
Primary Progressive MS (PPMS):

Marked by a steady progression of symptoms from the onset, without early relapses or remissions.
Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS):

Initially begins as relapsing-remitting MS but transitions into a phase of steady progression of symptoms with or without relapses.
Progressive-Relapsing MS (PRMS):

A rare form of MS that shows steady progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses.
SECTION 3 - SUMMARY:
From Section 1 (with SPOKE):

The SPOKE knowledge base identifies several types of multiple sclerosis, including Balo concentric sclerosis, primary progressive multiple sclerosis, progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Provenance for these associations is primarily from the Disease Ontology.
